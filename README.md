## Classifying News Articles

In response to the growing media crisis, this research project aims to use machine learning to quantify and classify news articles. The research team consists of Annabelle Gary ‘20, Jason Greenfield ‘20, Samantha Rydzewski ‘21, and Lesley Zheng ‘21, working with Professor Scott Alfeld in the computer science department.

This repository is divided into two parts to reflect two stages of our work: 1) fake news; 2) news sources. 

In the Fake News folder, we explored how machine learning can be used to identify whether a given piece of news article is real or fake, based on the label determined in the dataset given by MIT Lincoln Labs. In the news source folder, we shifted our focus to using machine learning to determine the news source of a piece of news article.

This research project is part of the 2018 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at Amherst College.

## Results

We presented our findings at the annual summer research symposium in September, 2018.
