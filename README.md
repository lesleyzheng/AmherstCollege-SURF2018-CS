# SURF2018_Classifying_News_Articles
In the summer of 2018, as part of the Amherst College summer undergraduate research fellowship, we worked as a team of four (Annabelle Gary ‘20, Jason Greenfield ‘20, Samantha Rydzewski ‘21, and Lesley Zheng ‘21) under Professor Scott Alfeld in the computer science department to explore the use of machine learning in quantifying and classifying news articles.  This repository is divided into two parts to reflect two stages of our work: 1) fake news; 2) news sources. In the Fake News folder, we explored how machine learning can be used to identify whether a given piece of news article is real or fake, based on the label determined in the dataset given by MIT Lincoln Labs. In the news source folder, we shifted our focus to using machine learning to determine the news source of a piece of news article.
